From the outside this house looks intimate and cozy. It has been built with wood covered in render and has white pine wooden decorations. Small, squared windows add to the overall look of the house and have been added to the house in a fairly symmetrical pattern.

The house is equipped with an average kitchen and one large bathroom, it also has a comfortable living room, three bedrooms, a small dining room and a grand basement.

The building is fairly rounded in shape. The house is fully surrounded by overgrown wooden overhanging panels.
The second floor is the same size as the first, but part of it hangs over the edge of the floor below, creating an overhang on one side and a balcony on the other. This floor has a different style than the floor below.

The roof is low, triangular and layered and is covered with seagrass. Two small chimneys poke out the center of the roof. Rows of small windows let in plenty of light to the rooms below the roof.
The house itself is surrounded by a tranquil garden, with various flowers, a long pond including a small waterfall and various rock formations.
