You pass forward through the faded portal hidden behind a waterfall. You're immediately met by a disconcerting world. You find yourself in almost complete darkness, were it not for the echoes you wouldn't even know you were underground. The light plays tricks on your eyes as shadows from a new landscape make your imagination go wild.
Even though this world's harsh you get the feeling you're not in immediate danger. This world is clearly treacherous, but you reckon you'll be fine as long as you're cautious.

Far behind you you see parts of creatures you've never seen before. They seem to have taken notice of your presence, the cautious path would be the best one. You can see bulky creatures, slithering creatures, and what you think might be huge creatures of some sort.

You're glad you brought plenty of supplies as discovery after discovery is waiting to be made. But, with some solid planning, an eye for details, and some scouting experience, you'll be able to make the most of this most wonderful opportunity.
